# Deleting objects and buckets<a name="DeletingAnObjectandBucket"></a>

When you no longer need an object or a bucket, we recommend that you delete them to prevent further charges\. If you completed this getting started walkthrough as a learning exercise and do not plan to use your bucket or objects, we recommend that you delete your bucket so that charges no longer accrue\. Before you delete your bucket, you must empty the bucket or delete the objects in the bucket\. After you delete your objects and bucket, they are no longer available\.

If you want to continue to use the same bucket name, we recommend that you delete the objects or empty the bucket but do not delete the bucket\. After you delete a bucket, the name becomes available to reuse\. However, another account might create a bucket with the same name before you have a chance to reuse it\.
